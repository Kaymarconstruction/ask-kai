## Chapter 1 – Laying Out Your First Job: Setouts, Stringlines & Levels

**Safety Reminder:**  
Trip hazards, sharp pins, and tensioned stringlines are common during layout. Mark your lines clearly, wear boots with solid grip, and never leave pegs or pins exposed where someone could trip or catch a tool.

### Why Layout Matters
Before any timber is cut or frame is stood up, the job must be *laid out*. Layout is how you transfer what’s on the plan onto the real ground, slab, or floor.

### Ask Kai
Still unsure about layout? Can’t remember the 3-4-5 rule or wondering if your lines are right?  
You’re not alone — layout can be tricky at first. It shows foresight, planning, and care — and the crew notices when you get it right.

## Chapter 2 – Framing Basics: Walls, Floors, and Roofs

**Safety Reminder:**  
Framing timber is heavy, sharp, and awkward to move. Always lift with your legs, not your back.

### Why Framing Matters
Framing is the skeleton of a build. If it’s not solid, straight, and square, everything else suffers.

### Ask Kai
Not sure which way your studs are meant to face? Confused by the difference between a trimmer and a lintel?

## Chapter 3 – Studs, Plates & Noggings: Anatomy of a Timber Frame

**Safety Reminder:**  
Most hand injuries happen here — from nail guns, awkward lifts, and rushing cuts.

### Why This Stuff Matters
These aren’t just pieces of timber. Studs, plates, and noggings are the bones of a wall.

### Ask Kai
If something doesn’t look right, ask. Good chippies ask questions early — saves time and money.

## Chapter 4 – Nailing It: Fixings, Fasteners & Gun Safety

**Safety Reminder:**  
Nail guns are the most dangerous tool for apprentices. Treat them with full respect — never assume.

### Ask Kai
Not sure what nail to use? Can’t get your gun to drive right?  
Drop me a line at [ask.kaymarconstruction.com](https://ask.kaymarconstruction.com). I’ll steer you straight.

## Chapter 5 – Install Skills: Windows, Doors, and Flashings

**Safety Reminder:**  
Windows and doors are heavy, awkward, and often made of glass. Always lift with a mate and brace properly.

### Ask Kai
If you’re unsure about a reveal gap, can’t get a door to swing right, or want to see how to flash a tricky sill detail,  
send it over to [ask.kaymarconstruction.com](https://ask.kaymarconstruction.com)

## Chapter 6 – First Fix Mistakes to Avoid

**Safety Reminder:**  
Framing accidents happen when you rush. PPE and planning save more time than redoing work.

### Ask Kai
If you’ve stuffed something or aren’t sure how to fix it, ask. I’ve stood behind miles of bad framing and pulled it straight.
