## About the Author

K. Marlowe is a master carpenter and seasoned site manager with over two decades of experience in Australian residential construction. His career spans hands-on carpentry, small business ownership, lean construction systems, and mentoring young tradies. Through Kaymar Construction and the *Ask Kai* initiative, he now focuses on equipping the next generation of apprentices with practical, grounded, real-world skills that go beyond textbooks.

Kai has trained dozens of apprentices and believes that success in the trades comes from consistency, safety, and smart systems — not shortcuts. His writing is straightforward, no-fluff, and always focused on building both skill and confidence.

When he's not writing or building, you’ll find him running tool audits, refining workflows, or showing a young apprentice how to get their first frame square and plumb.
