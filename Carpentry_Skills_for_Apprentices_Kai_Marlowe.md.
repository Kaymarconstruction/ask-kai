## Introduction – From Tools to Timber

If you’ve made it this far, you’ve already got your boots dirty.

You’ve learned your tools, figured out how a jobsite works, and picked up the safety habits that make or break a good tradie. That was step one — now it’s time to start *building*.

This book is your guide to turning those early lessons into real-world carpentry skills. It’s where you take your toolkit and start using it on jobs that matter: framing walls, laying out rooms, fixing in windows, installing doors, and working shoulder-to-shoulder with a crew on an actual structure.

Because it’s one thing to know how to use a hammer. It’s another thing entirely to use it to frame a wall that’s straight, plumb, and strong.

### Ask Kai

You don’t have to know everything yet. You just have to show up, stay switched on, and be willing to learn.

Got a question? That’s what *Ask Kai* is for.

If something in this book doesn’t make sense, or if you’re on site and stuck, reach out. Chances are, if you’re thinking it, another apprentice is too.

This book is about more than timber and nails — it’s about helping you grow into a confident, capable carpenter who can be trusted with the next job, the next task, and eventually, the next apprentice.

Keep asking. Keep building. I’ve got your back.

## Chapter 1 – Laying Out Your First Job: Setouts, Stringlines & Levels

**Safety Reminder:**  
Trip hazards, sharp pins, and tensioned stringlines are common during layout. Mark your lines clearly, wear boots with solid grip, and never leave pegs or pins exposed where someone could trip or catch a tool.

### Why Layout Matters

Before any timber is cut or frame is stood up, the job must be *laid out*. Layout is how you transfer what’s on the plan onto the real ground, slab, or floor. Get the layout wrong, and everything after it — frames, trusses, cladding — is out of whack. Get it right, and the whole job flows.

### What You’ll Learn in This Chapter

- How to read a basic site plan  
- Tools and gear for setout  
- How to mark straight, square, and level lines  
- How to run stringlines, measure diagonals, and check square  

### Tools You’ll Use

- Stringlines  
- Stakes or batter boards  
- Tape measures (2x)  
- Spirit or laser level  
- Builder’s square / 3-4-5 method  
- Chalk, spray paint, pencil  
- Hammer or mallet  
- PPE (gloves, boots, high-vis, eye pro)

### Step-by-Step Layout Process

1. Clean and inspect surface  
2. Establish base line from longest wall  
3. Use 3-4-5 or square to find 90°  
4. Run tight stringlines for all wall edges  
5. Measure diagonals to check square  
6. Mark all key wall and opening locations  

### Apprentice Checklist

- [ ] Cleaned surface and located reference edge  
- [ ] Marked out and squared lines  
- [ ] Double-checked diagonals  
- [ ] Pegged or tied stringlines properly  
- [ ] Communicated setup with foreman  

### Ask Kai

Still unsure about layout? Can’t remember the 3-4-5 rule or wondering if your lines are right? That’s what *Ask Kai* is for.

## Chapter 2 – Framing Basics: Walls, Floors, and Roofs

**Safety Reminder:**  
Framing timber is heavy, sharp, and awkward to move. Always lift with your legs, not your back. Use gloves when handling splintery stock, and never frame under hanging loads or unsupported materials.

### Why Framing Matters

Framing is the skeleton of a build. If it’s not solid, straight, and square, everything else suffers. This chapter shows how floor, wall, and roof frames go together and what your role is in making that happen.

### What You’ll Learn

- Framing terms  
- Floor, wall, and roof sequencing  
- Apprentice roles and contributions  
- Key measurements, layout, and safety tips  

### The Three Stages

**1. Floor Framing** – Joists, bearers, level and load  
**2. Wall Framing** – Studs, plates, noggings, openings  
**3. Roof Framing** – Intro to trusses and positioning

### Key Tasks for Apprentices

- Marking out plates  
- Cutting and checking studs  
- Assisting with frame layout  
- Bracing and fixing off  
- Keeping the site clean and clear

### Apprentice Framing Checklist

- [ ] Checked framing plan  
- [ ] Marked out walls/studs/noggings  
- [ ] Worked safe and used PPE  
- [ ] Stored offcuts and cleaned work area  

### Ask Kai

Not sure which way your studs are meant to face? Confused by the difference between a trimmer and a lintel?
